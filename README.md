## Why Printify Check?

Dealing with PDFs for print or digital distribution can be fraught with errors. Traditional preflight tools are often:
*   **Expensive:** High licensing costs create barriers for freelancers, small businesses, and even larger organizations looking for scalable solutions.
*   **Complex:** Steep learning curves and overly complicated interfaces can waste valuable time.
*   **Limited:** Many tools lack integrated OCR, robust redaction, or the flexibility needed for modern workflows.
*   **Proprietary:** Closed-source nature prevents transparency, customization, and community-driven improvements.

Printify Check aims to solve these problems by providing a feature-rich, open, and cost-effective solution.

## The Printify Check Solution

Printify Check is engineered to be the ultimate open-source toolkit for PDF professionals, offering:

*   **Comprehensive Preflight:** Leveraging a powerful backend, Printify Check performs deep analysis of PDF internals, targeting **an initial 58+ essential checks with a roadmap to 200-350+ granular validations** covering all aspects of document integrity for print and digital use.
*   **Intelligent Automated Fixes:** Go beyond simple checks. Printify Check aims to provide **an initial 25+ key automated fixes, expanding to 70+ intelligent solutions** to resolve common and complex PDF issues with precision.
*   **Web-Based SaaS Platform:** Access powerful preflight capabilities from any browser, anywhere. No complex desktop installations.
*   **Integrated OCR & Redaction:** Transform scanned documents into searchable PDFs and securely redact sensitive information, all within one platform.
*   **Truly Open Source (AGPLv3):** Transparency, security, and the power of community collaboration to build the best tool possible.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Free for individuals and teams, with potential for community-supported or very affordable premium features in the future (while keeping the core AGPL).

## Core Capabilities (The Nitty-Gritty)

Printify Check is built to perform a deep and wide array of checks and fixes. For an exhaustive, technical list, please see our [DETAILED_FEATURES.md](DETAILED_FEATURES.md) (Note: You will need to create this file and populate it with the detailed list we discussed).

Here's a summary of key areas:

### In-Depth Preflight Checks

*   **Document Structure & Metadata:**
    *   XMP, Document Info Dictionary, PDF version, page structure, bookmarks, named destinations, attachments, layers (OCGs), logical structure (Tagged PDF).
*   **Page Geometry & Layout:**
    *   Precise validation of all page boxes (Media, Crop, Bleed, Trim, Art), content overflow/underflow, safety margins, page scaling/rotation consistency, empty page detection, printer mark analysis.
*   **Fonts & Text:**
    *   Deep font embedding analysis (full, subset, ToUnicode, CIDSet, CMap), type validation (flagging Type3, etc.), integrity checks, missing glyph detection, small text/stroke weight, text color (rich black, 100%K), invisible text, text as paths, basic hyphenation/justification.
*   **Images & Vector Graphics:**
    *   Image type/format, color space (including ICC profiles), effective resolution (DPI/PPI), compression analysis, OPI comments, hairlines, vector path complexity, embedded rasters in vectors, smooth shade/gradient validation.
*   **Color (Object-Level & Global):**
    *   Exhaustive identification of all color spaces (DeviceRGB, CMYK, Gray, CalRGB, Lab, ICCBased, Separation, DeviceN, Indexed, Pattern).
    *   RGB/Lab detection in CMYK workflows.
    *   Precise spot color usage analysis (name, alternate space, tint, comparison against user libraries).
    *   Registration color validation.
    *   Detailed rich black analysis.
    *   Total Area Coverage (TAC/TIC) based on target ICC profiles.
    *   Gamut checking.
    *   ICC profile validation (integrity, version, class).
*   **Transparency & Overprint:**
    *   Comprehensive detection of live transparency (blend modes, opacity, masks, groups).
    *   Atomic region analysis.
    *   Precise overprint settings validation (fill, stroke, OPM flag).
    *   White object overprint and black object knockout detection.
    *   Overprint interactions with spot colors.
*   **ISO Standards Compliance:**
    *   **PDF/A Conformance (via veraPDF):** Exhaustive validation against all PDF/A parts (PDF/A-1 through PDF/A-4, including all conformance levels).
    *   **PDF/UA Conformance (via veraPDF):** Full validation for accessibility standards.
    *   **PDF/X Conformance (Custom Logic):** Aiming for comprehensive checks against PDF/X standards (PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-3, PDF/X-4, etc.).
*   **Security, Forms & Actions:**
    *   Encryption status, permission flags, interactive form field analysis, JavaScript validation, action type validation.

### Powerful Automated Fixes

*   **Document Structure & Metadata:** Repair/reconstruct XMP/DocInfo, generate bookmarks, set page labels, flatten/merge layers.
*   **Page Geometry & Layout:** Set/adjust page boxes, normalize scaling/rotation, remove empty pages, shift content, add/remove printer marks.
*   **Fonts & Text:** Subset fonts, convert text to paths, programmatic text color changes.
*   **Images & Vector Graphics:** Convert hairlines. (Image processing like resampling, recompression, color conversion primarily delegated to Ghostscript).
*   **Color:** Remap specific object colors, force black compositions. (Global color conversions via Ghostscript).
*   **Transparency & Overprint:** Selectively remove/force overprint. (Global transparency flattening via Ghostscript).
*   **Security, Forms & Actions:** Remove encryption, flatten forms, remove JavaScript/actions.
*   **Global Document Fixes (via Ghostscript):**
    *   ICC-aware color conversions (e.g., RGB to CMYK).
    *   Advanced image processing (downsampling, recompression).
    *   Comprehensive transparency flattening.
    *   PDF/A conversion.
    *   Font embedding and subsetting.
    *   PDF optimization and repair.
    *   PDF version leveling.
